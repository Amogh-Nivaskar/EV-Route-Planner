> make a git repo and push to github

> recenter the map to the EV location as the EV moves on the map

> Make EV object class
    attributes: battery capacity, state of charge, discharge rate, location, 

    > When EV moves, it consumes battery charge, depending on the speed of EV and time for which it moved
      Let's assume: battery discharge = C * speed of EV * 1/time (where 'C' is a constant)

    > movement of EV marker on map should be controlled by this class's methods (refactor index.js)

> display following stats: 
  - Speed
  - battery discharge
  - charging time 

> implement waiting feature at station <------- DONE -------->
